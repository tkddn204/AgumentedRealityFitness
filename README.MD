**This project has been being made.** forked from [OpenCVSharp3Unity](https://github.com/qian256/OpenCVSharp3Unity)

## What make?
I'll make it easy for users to Fitness(Exercise). I tried to use "UnityForOpenCV" or "OpenCVPlus(Unity)" **but** the budget is not enough. So I try to create a project using OpenCVSharp. **Very Very** Thank you for [Long Qian](http://longqian.me/aboutme/) is the source of this project.
